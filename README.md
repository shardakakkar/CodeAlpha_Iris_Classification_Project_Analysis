# Iris Flower Classification with Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species using machine learning techniques. The model predicts whether a flower belongs to Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key Highlights
- Used Iris flower measurements as input data
- Trained a machine learning classification model
- Evaluated model accuracy and performance
- Learned basic classification concepts in machine learning

## Dataset
The Iris dataset containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three Iris flower species.
